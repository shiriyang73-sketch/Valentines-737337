          <p>My Dearest Elaiza,</p>
          <p>
            Every moment we spend together, even through a screen, feels like a beautiful dream I never want to wake up from. 
            You are my sunshine, my everything, and the distance only makes me love you more.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this Valentine's Day, I just want you to know — you are the most amazing person 
            I've ever known, and I fall more in love with you every single day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forever & Always yours 💕
          </p>
